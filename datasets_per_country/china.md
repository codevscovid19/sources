The maps provided by https://github.com/shfshanyue/2019-ncov go down to city in China. The file "src/data/area.json" seems to provide data down per City in China, but not outside China and only the current situation without timestamps. The file "src/data/countries.json" provides data with timestamps, but only per country. (edited)
